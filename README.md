This was an assignment for the React portion of my coding bootcamp. It is a virtual version of my CV. It's entirely possible that it is what brought you to my Github profile!

**Stack used**: JavaScript - React - CSS

## How to install this project

1. Clone the repository on Github into a directory of your choice.
2. If you don't already have Npm installed, go ahead and do that first.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the repository, and open a new terminal window. Type `npm install` to get the node modules on your local computer.
4. Type `npm start` to get the app up and running - it should open in a new browser tab.
